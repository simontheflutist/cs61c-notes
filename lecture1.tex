\section{Everything is a number}
The atom of computer information is a \emph{bit}.
A \emph{byte} is 8 bits.
A \emph{word} is 4 bytes.
A FP number is 64 bits.

\subsection{Binary and decimal}
\begin{description}
	\item[binary] \(\left\{0,1\right\}\)-linear sum of \(\ldots64, 32, 16, 8, 2, 1\).
	\item[decimal] Sum of multiples of powers of 10 (familiar).
\end{description}

Convert \(x\) from decimal to binary, recursively
building from left to right
(most significant, second most significant\ldots):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If \(x\) is 0, stop.
	\item Parity of \(x\) is next most significant bit.
	\item Floordiv \(x \leftarrow x/2\).
	\item Back to first step.
\end{enumerate}

Hexadecimal groups 4 bits at a time.
