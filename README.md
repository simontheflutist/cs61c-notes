# cs61c-notes

Hey! I'm busier than usual this semester (Fall of my sophomore year),
so I realized that it probably behooved me to start taking proper in-class notesâ€”I'm telling
myself this will help me make the most of my lectures and ideally
work more efficiently and correctly on homework and projects.

Open-sourcing because sharing is caring!
